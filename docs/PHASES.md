### Notes — Phase 10
- Owner rule: replies follow the owner's language (Bangla/Banglish → Bangla, English → English); web originals stay, with a summary in the owner's language.
- Gemini API text adapter pulled forward from Phase 14 at the owner's request (2026-09-25), routed only for `summarization` (`free_tier_only`); reasoning/vision routing stays for Phase 14.
- Bot checks (CAPTCHA) are never solved → task ends `BLOCKED_NEEDS_USER`.
- General web search without a named site = Phase 16 research agent.
